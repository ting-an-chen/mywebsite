               <div class="entry-content">
                 <p>First of all, I have to admit that there are still a lot of things I don't know about hospice care. I am still learning from my patients and all the experiences i had. This is a piece of memory from me and a bit of my own thoughts.... </p>
                 <p>Miss pretty had been staying in our ward for one and a half months already, but I never had a chance to take care of her until two days before she passed away. </p>
                 <p>She was diagnosed of Hepatocellular Carcinoma with lung metastasis, came to our ward this time because of Sepsis shock, to seek for better infection control and also symptom relieve from her recurring ascites and plural effusion. She was also suffering from schizophrenia and depression, taking anti-psychotic drugs for more than 10 years. It was much earlier before she was diagnose of cancer. During her stay she had recovered and was preparing her to go back home, but then one day her condition got worse, she suffered from more severe dyspepsia and a relapse fever.  Her husband had been taking care of her through the whole time.</p>
                 <p>Dr. Chen already talked with her and her husband about signing DNR(Do Not Resuscitation)agreement a month ago when she came to the hospital, that there is no more better treatment to cure and control her cancer. Miss pretty claimed that she wanted no pain and no more suffering when the end of life comes.</p>
                 <p>The first morning interacting with her, she looked weak and pale, frowning and complaining about feeling shortness of breath. Around 20 mins ago the night shift had just given her an extra dose of 5mg morphine. I gave her another dose of steroid and some broncodilator wish to smooth her breath, but it didn't help either. Her discomforts made her restless on the bed. Her oxygen saturation is dropping to 83%(for a healthy person it should be around 95-100%). Her husband was anxious too watching her suffering. The only thing I could do is to calm him down. </p>
                 <p>I didnt have enough knowledge to conclude whether if its her anxiousness, or her pain, or really is the tumor in her lung progressing fast making her felt that she couldn't breathe. Or maybe could be that it was her having delirium, having an altered mental status at the moment, her restless came from unawareness of agitation. </p>
                 <p>The practitioner nurse came and told me to give Miss Pretty some sedations. I don't feel really comfortable with it. Miss Pretty had never been given sedations before and i had this feeling after that she would be entering the phase of dying. Sedations are considered to be the last resort used at the end of life to relieve severe and refractory symptoms, and inducing a state of decreased awareness or absent awareness. Soon after the drug was given, Miss Pretty was calmed down and was sleeping deeply for the reset of the day during my shift. The day before this she could still get up and eat some food, now she could barely open her eyes.</p>
                 <p>The next day back at work, the night shift complained that Miss Pretty was again agitated the whole night. even after given few more sedations. Problems occur when communicating with her husband about giving sedations. He worried that after the drug given she is not able to intake food anymore. This morning,Miss pretty was back to her deep sleep when i saw her. But her breathing pattern was different from yesterday, its a "sighing respiration", when her exhalation became super short like signing, the breath is deeper and harder. She is also having a high fever up to 39 degree today. Her husband was complaining that the doctors promise she wouldn't suffer like this. The oncology doctor, the practitioner nurse, and the palliative doctor came and went straight forward to explain to him, that his wife is now almost till the end of her life. They point out the obvious sign to him; the sighing respiration, high fever because of the brain losing its function to regulates the body temperature, more time sleeping than awake, eating less...Nwo when she keeps sleeping like this would actually more comfortable for her. </P>
                 <p>I was a bit shock about how they went so straight forward discussing about his wife's death with him. I wouldn't know how much of information he could handle. I was observing him while they were talking, to my surprise he was super calm. There were no tears in his eyes. The palliative doctor further on discuss with him about where the patient wanted to pass away, Miss Pretty had this last wish that she wanted to die at home, and her husband wish to fulfill her wish. (One of my colleges told me that there's a traditional believe that if people could't die at home, their soul wouldnt be able to find their way back and became ghost wondering around the world.)</P>
                 <p>Her husband was paying full attention through the whole discussion. I could feel that his only wish is that she wouldn't have to suffer in the end of life, and he wanted to do everything he could to help. There were some caregivers i met before who had been denying the fact that their love ones will be dying soon and wish to seek for other treatments at any costs, they don't want to give up any hope till the last minutes but made their love ones suffer more by different complications. I admire how Miss Pretty's husband adjust himself to face death, how he was so prepared and so sure about what he hopes.</P>
                 <p>The rest of the day, higher dose of painkiller and sedation were prescribe to Miss Pretty for better symptom relief. I gave the husband a bit more information about the price for the ambulance to take her home, and make sure everything was prepared when the time comes to sent Miss Pretty home. I suggested that I help him give Miss Pretty a bed bath(clean her with warm towel on the bed), since she hadn't taken a shower for few days. We cleaned her mouth also to make sure that while staying there unconscious, she maintain comfortable and clean, I thought in this way, inviting her husband to be a part of her journey, he would feel happy that he could still do something for her.</P>
                 <p>That afternoon Miss Pretty's youngest son came. Her psychiatric physician also came, he had been cooperating with the primary care team to make adjustment for her anti-psychotic drugs during her stay. He asked if the husband had enough rest, he encouraged him and his son to recall their memories they had with Miss Pretty. The husband recalled that in August they just came back from a trip to the US in San Francisco, they had a good time together. The son remembered how she started to have hallucinations and diagnosed of schizophrenia, started her life with taking pills everyday. Being diagnose of cancer was another striking news to her, how she is always afraid of dying and afraid of the pain...</P>
                 <p>At least now deep in her sleep, she looks calm without any pain.</P>
                 <p>In end of the day, we continue to keep her comfort and keep waiting. Even the doctors can't predict when the time would come. We waited for the sign of life slowly fading away, but there were only slightly drop of her blood pressure. Everyone seemed so much prepared, mentally and physically, that there were no grief sensed in the room. There was just one goal that we all are now fighting for--we will sent her back home till the very end.  </P>
                 <p>Before the end of my shift, I saw Miss Pretty's husband holding her hand and taking a selfie with her. I offered to take some photos for the,. I remembered years ago, how i was struck by the grief when i saw my grandma's body turned into bone and dusts after the funeral. I realized her body was gone forever. I was imagining one day Miss Pretty's body would be gone too, maybe a picture, a really physical touch is something that her husband could still hold on tight, and is so much important to him at this moment. Its also a piece of memory to him that he accompanied her through the rest of her life and how he complete his promise in their wedding vows: "for better or for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish; until death do us part....."</P>
                 <p>The next day when I got back to work, my colleagues told me that Miss Pretty and her husband finally went home in the early morning.</P>
