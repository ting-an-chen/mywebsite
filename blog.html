                 <p>First of all, I have to admit that there are still a lot of things I don't know about hospice care. I am still learning from my patients and all the experiences i had. This is a piece of memory from me and a bit of my own thoughts.... </p>

                 <p>Miss pretty had been staying in our ward for one and a half months already, but I never had a chance to take care of her until two days before she passed away. </p>
                  
                 <p>She was diagnosed of Hepatocellular Carcinoma with lung metastasis, came to our ward this time because of Sepsis shock, to seek for better infection control and also symptom relieve from her recurring ascites and plural effusion. She was also suffering from schizophrenia and depression, taking anti-psychotic drugs for more than 10 years. It was much earlier before she was diagnose of cancer. During her stay she had recovered and was preparing her to go back home, but then one day her condition got worse, she suffered from more severe dyspepsia and a relapse fever.  Her husband had been taking care of her through the whole time.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Happy, a 66-year-old man, heavy smoker, having hypertension and DM under medications, was diagnosed as having adenocarcinoma of right lower lung, with metastasis of brain, thyroid and multiple lymph nodes. He was going through chemotherapy, radiotherapy since July of 2018.</p>
                  <p>I remembered Mr. Happy quite well. I first met him in December of 2018, he came to our ward because of pneumonia and was under antibiotic treatments. He was this guy not so tall, with a bit of grey hair, the rough touch of his hands and mud stuck in his fingernails showed himself as a farmer.  He was this cheerful old man, I remembered the first time I took care of him, he was first laughing at my not-so-fluent Taiwanese, but still tried to communicate with me. In the end we both laughed about my awful Taiwanese. He had a beloved wife who took care of him through every time of his admission. Mr. Happy always likes to put his legs on the accompany chair where his wife sleeps, while himself sleeping on his manual bed. </p>
